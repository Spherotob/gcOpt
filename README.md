# gcOpt
Determination of product-growth-coupled strain designs employing stoichiometric metabolic models.

For an introduction to gcOpt, open and run "gcOpt_Example.m".

Usage of Matlab 2016b (https://de.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) or later versions as well as the gurobi 7 (www.gurobi.com/) solver are recommended.
COBRA toolbox is additionally needed (https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/)
